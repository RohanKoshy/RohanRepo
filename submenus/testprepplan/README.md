Since me, Justin, and Kian are the only members in our 8 person group who will take the AP test this May, our test plan will primarily consist of reviewing material directly from the AP college board FRQs and MCQs, as well as rewatching the tutorial videos. We will start going through each unit week by the week together, meeting to talk about any questions or doubts we have, in addition to doing our pbl work.
