Since me, Justin, and Kian are the only members in our 8 person group who will take the AP test this May, our test plan will primarily consist of reviewing material directly from the AP college board FRQs and MCQs, as well as rewatching the tutorial videos. We will start going through each unit week by the week together, meeting to talk about any questions or doubts we have, in addition to doing our pbl work.
Ap Test prep plan: 

**-Review One unit per week, this will give ample time to review all content.**



- Week of April 11th: Complete review over basic Java syntax: ex: for loop, defining classes, casting variables


- Week of April 18th: Complete review of object-oriented java features such as inheritance, encapsulation, child/parent classes, abstract classes


- Week of April 25th: Complete review of Data Structures and Sorting Algorithims


- Week of April 26th-May 3rd: Begin working on Practice tests and Practice FRQs
